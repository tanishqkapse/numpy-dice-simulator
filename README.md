# 🎲 NumPy Dice Simulator

A simple Python project using NumPy to simulate rolling a 6-sided dice 1000 times and counting how often each number appears.

## 📌 Features
- Simulates 1000 dice rolls
- Counts how many times each face (1 to 6) appears
- Uses NumPy's random and boolean indexing features
- Super lightweight and beginner-friendly

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Random number generation with NumPy
- Boolean indexing and counting
- Basic simulation logic

## 🛠️ Requirements
numpy
Install with:
```bash
pip install numpy


🚀 How to Run
